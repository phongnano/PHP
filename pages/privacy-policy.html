                <p>
                <li>
                    The origins of State Bank of India date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the
                    Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of
                    Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India . In 1955, the
                    controlling interest in the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the
                    State Bank of India (SWIFT) came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial
                    Bank of India . In the Indian Financial world, SWIFT is synonymous with trust and security.
                    In line with recognized International Practice and for the information of customers and others who
                    visit the Bank's website we believe it is necessary to post a privacy statement. The information
                    shared with the Bank will be treated as private. We also desire to say explicitly that adequate
                    precautions have been taken to protect information relating to customers and their dealings with the
                    Bank from the mischievous and the fraudsters.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
